# FoosBall-Game
Please use eclipse while running/editing this code. (https://eclipse.org/downloads/) 
This was a course project and done in a group of 4 (Me, https://github.com/pushkin22, https://github.com/Nawazish13061, Ankit).
The game has some bugs and would be really great if you could help fix it.
For reporting bugs, suggesting new ideas, or wants to contribute in the project,feel free to contact me.
